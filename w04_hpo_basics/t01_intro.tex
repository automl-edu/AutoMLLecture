\begin{frame}[containsverbatim,allowframebreaks]{Motivating Example}

\begin{itemize}
\item Given a dataset, we want to train a classification tree.
\item We feel that a maximum tree depth of $4$ has worked out well for us previously, so we decide to set this hyperparameter to $4$.
\item The learner ("inducer") $\inducer$ takes the input data, internally performs \textbf{empirical risk minimization}, and returns a fitted tree model $\fh(\x) = f(\x, \hat{\theta})$ of at most depth $\conf = 4$ that minimizes the empirical risk.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item We are \textbf{actually} interested in the \textbf{generalization performance} $GE\left(\fh\right)$ of the estimated model on new, previously unseen data.
\item We estimate the generalization performance by evaluating the model $\fh$ on a test set $\datasettest$: $$
\widehat{GE}_{\datasettest}\left(\fh\right) = \frac{1}{|\datasettest|} \sum\limits_{(\x, y) \in \datasettest} L\left(y, \fh(\x) \right)
$$

\begin{itemize}
\vfill
\item But many ML algorithms are sensitive w.r.t. a good setting of their hyperparameters,
and generalization performance might be bad, if we have chosen a suboptimal configuration:
\begin{itemize}
\vfill
\item The data may be too complex to be modeled by a tree of depth $4$
\vfill
\item The data may be much simpler than we thought, and a tree of depth $4$ overfits
\end{itemize}
\vfill
\item[$\implies$] algorithmically try out different values for the tree depth. For each maximal depth $\conf$, we have to train the model \textbf{to completion} and evaluate its performance on the test set.
\vfill
\item We choose the tree depth $\conf$ that is \textbf{optimal} w.r.t. the generalization error of the model.
\end{itemize}

% $\to$ Finding the hyperparameter $\lambda$ that is optimal w.r.t. the generalization performance constitutes an optimization problem.

% \begin{frame}[containsverbatim,allowframebreaks]{The role of hyperparameters}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Hyperparameters often control the complexity of a model, i.e., how flexible the model is.
% \item But they can in principle influence any structural property of a model or computational part of the training process.
% \item If a model is not flexible enough, it cannot approximate the relationship between the features and the output well and will underfit.
% \item If a model is too flexible so that it simply \textit{memorizes} the training data, we will face the dreaded problem of overfitting.
% \item[$\implies$] Hence, controlling the model's capacity, i.e., finding suitable hyperparameters,
% can prevent overfitting the model on the training set.
% \end{itemize}

% \end{frame}

\begin{frame}[containsverbatim,allowframebreaks]{Model Parameters vs. Hyperparameters}

It is critical to understand the difference between model parameters and hyperparameters.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Model parameters} are optimized during training, typically via loss minimization. They are an \textbf{output} of the training. Examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item The splits and terminal node constants of a tree learner
\item Coefficients $\theta$ of a linear model $\fx = \theta^\top\x$
\end{itemize}

\framebreak

In contrast, \textbf{hyperparameters} (HPs) are not decided during training. They must be specified before the training, they are an \textbf{input} of the training.
Hyperparameters often control the complexity of a model, i.e., how flexible the model is.
But they can in principle influence any structural property of a model or computational part of the training process.

\vspace{0.5cm}

Examples:

\begin{itemize}
\item Tree: The maximum depth of a tree
\item $k$ Nearest Neighbours: Number of neighbours $k$ and distance measure
\item Linear regression: Number and maximal order of interactions
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[containsverbatim,allowframebreaks]{Types of hyperparameters}

We summarize all hyperparameters we want to tune over in a vector $\conf \in \pcs$ of (possibly) mixed type. HPs can have different types:

\begin{itemize}
\item Real-valued parameters, e.g.:
\begin{itemize}
\item Minimal error improvement in a tree to accept a split
\item Bandwidths of the kernel density estimates for Naive Bayes
\end{itemize}
\item Integer parameters, e.g.:
\begin{itemize}
\item Neighbourhood size $k$ for $k$-NN
\item Minimum number of samples for a split in a random forest
\end{itemize}
\item Categorical parameters, e.g.:
\begin{itemize}
\item Which split criterion for classification trees?
\item Which distance measure for $k$-NN?
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Hyperparameters are often \textbf{hierarchically dependent} on each other, e.g., \emph{if} we use
a kernel-density estimate for Naive Bayes, what is its width?
% with polynomials of the features up to a certain maximal degree $d$, then
% we must specify whether to also include polynomial interaction terms like e.g. $x_j^{d-d'}x_m^{d'}$ or not
% and up to which degree $d' \leq d$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Tuning}

\vskip 3em
Recall: \textbf{Hyperparameters} $\conf$ are parameters that are \emph{inputs} to the
training problem, in which a learner $\inducer$ minimizes the empirical risk on a training data set in order
to find optimal \textbf{model parameters} $\theta$ which define the fitted model $\fh$.
\vskip 2em

\textbf{(Hyperparameter) Tuning} is the process of finding good model hyperparameters $\conf$.

\begin{frame}[containsverbatim,allowframebreaks]{Tuning: A bi-level optimization problem}

\vspace{0.2cm}

We face a \textbf{bi-level} optimization problem: The well-known risk minimization problem to find $\hat f$ is \textbf{nested} within the outer hyperparameter optimization (also called second-level problem):

\begin{itemize}
\item For a learning algorithm $\inducer$ (also inducer) with $d$ hyperparameters, the hyperparameter \textbf{configuration space} is:
$$\pcs=\pcs_{1} \times \pcs_{2} \times \ldots \times \pcs_{d}$$
where $\pcs_{i}$ is the domain of the $i$-th hyperparameter.
\item The domains can be continuous, discrete or categorical.
\item For practical reasons, the domain of a continuous or integer-valued hyperparameter is typically bounded.
\item A vector in this configuration space is denoted as $\conf \in \pcs$.
\item A learning algorithm $\inducer$ takes a (training) dataset $\dataset$ and a hyperparameter configuration $\conf \in \pcs$ and returns a trained model (through risk minimization).

\vspace*{-0.2cm}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\inducer: \left(\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y}\right)^n \times \pcs &\to& \mathcal{H} \\
(\dataset, \pcs) &\mapsto& \inducer(\dataset, \pcs) = \hat f_{\dataset, \pcs}
\end{eqnarray*}
% \item Additionally, some hyperparameters may only need to be specified if another hyperparameter (or combination of hyperparameters) takes on a certain value.
\end{itemize}

% \vspace{0.5cm}

% Note that

% In contrast to the first-level (empirical) risk minimization problem, hyperparameter optimization is also referred to as \textbf{second-level} optimization. The first-level problem can be seen as a subroutine called by the second-level problem: Each evaluation of $\pcs$ requires to solve the first-level optimization problem.

% The hyperparameter optimization problem is difficult in many ways:

\framebreak

We formally state the nested hyperparameter tuning problem as:

$$
    \min_{\conf \in \pcs} \cost(\conf) = \widehat{GE}_{\datasettest}\left(\inducer(\datasettrain, \conf)\right)
$$

\begin{itemize}
\item The learner $\inducer(\datasettrain, \conf)$ takes a training dataset as well as hyperparameter settings $\pcs$ (e.g.\ the maximal depth of a classification tree) as an input.
\item $\inducer(\datasettrain, \conf)$ performs empirical risk minimization on the training data and returns the optimal model $\hat f$ for the given hyperparameters.
\item Note that for the estimation of the generalization error, more sophisticated resampling strategies like cross-validation can be used.
\end{itemize}

\framebreak

The components of a tuning problem are:

\begin{itemize}
\item The dataset
\item The learner (possibly: several competing learners?) that is tuned %(e.g. a decision tree classifier)
\item The learner's hyperparameters and their respective regions-of-interest over which we optimize % (e.g. $\texttt{tree depth} \in \{1, 2, ..., 20\}$)
\item The performance measure, as determined by the application.\\ Not necessarily identical to the loss function that defines the risk minimization problem for the learner!\\
% We could even be interested in multiple measures simultaneously, e.g., accuracy and computation time of our model, TPR and PPV, etc.
\item A (resampling) procedure for estimating the predictive performance according to the performance measure.
 % The expected performance on unseen data can be estimated by holdout (i.e., a single train-test-split) or more advanced techniques like cross-validation.
% More on this later.

\begin{frame}{Why is tuning so hard?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Tuning is derivative-free (black box problem): It is usually impossible to compute derivatives of the objective (i.e., the resampled performance measure) that we optimize with regard to the HPs. All we can do is evaluate the performance for a given hyperparameter configuration.
\item Every evaluation requires one or multiple train and predict steps of the learner. I.e., every evaluation is very \textbf{expensive}.
\item Even worse: the answer we get from that evaluation is \textbf{not exact, but stochastic} in most settings, as we use resampling (and often stochastic learners).
\item Categorical and dependent hyperparameters aggravate our difficulties: the space of hyperparameters we optimize over has a non-metric, complicated structure.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

% \framebreak

% Possible scenarios for finding default hyperparameters:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item If the learner's performance is fairly insensitive to changes of a hyperparameter, we don't really have to worry as long as we remain within the range of reasonable values.
% \item Constant default: we can benchmark the learner across a broad range of data sets and scenarios and try to find hyperparameter values that work well in many different situations. Quite optimistic?
% \item Dynamic (heuristic) default: We can benchmark the learner across a broad range of data sets and scenarios and try to find an easily computable function that sets the hyperparameter in a data dependent way,
% e.g. using \texttt{mtry}$ = p/3$ for RF.\\
% How to construct or learn that heuristic function, though...?
% \item In some cases, can try to set hyperparameters optimally by extracting more info from the fitted model. E.g. \texttt{ntrees} for a random forest (does OOB error increase or decrease if you remove trees from the ensemble?).
