\begin{frame}[c,allowframebreaks]{MS-Continuity and Differentiability}

We wish to describe a Gaussian process in terms of its smoothness. There are several notions of continuity for random variables. One is the continuity/differentiability in mean square (MS).

\begin{block}{Definition}
A Gaussian process $f(\x)$ is said to be \textbf{MS continuous} at $\x_*$, if
\vspace{-3mm}
$$\expectation[|f(\xI{k}) - f(\x_*)|^2] \overset{k \to \infty}{\longrightarrow} 0 \text{ for all converging sequences } \xI{k} \overset{k \to \infty}{\longrightarrow} \x_*.$$

\vspace{5mm}
A Gaussian process $f(\x)$ is said to be \textbf{MS differentiable} along the $i$ direction, if the following limit exists, with $\bm{e}_i = (0,\dots,0,1,0,\dots,0)^\top$ being the unit vector along the $i$-th axis. $$\lim_{h\to 0}\expectation[|\frac{f(\x + h\,\bm{e}_i) - f(\x)}{h}|]$$ 
\end{block}


 

\framebreak
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{itemize}
\item The MS continuity/differentiability do not necessarily lead to the continuity/differentiability of sampled functions!
\vspace{.5cm}

\item The MS continuity/differentiability of a Gaussian process can be derived from the smoothness properties of the kernel.
\vspace{.5cm}

\item The GP is continuous in MS iff the covariance function $k(\x, \x^\prime)$ is continuous.
\vspace{.5cm}

\item The MS derivative of a Gaussian process exists iff the second derivative $\frac{\partial^{2} k(\x, \x^\prime)}{\partial \x\partial \x^\prime}$ exists.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[c]{Squared Exponential Covariance Function}

The squared exponential function is one of the most commonly used covariance functions.
$$
k(\x, \x^\prime) = \exp\biggl(- \frac{\|\x - \x^\prime\|^2}{2\ls^2}\biggr).
$$

\textbf{Properties}:
\begin{itemize}
\item[\faLightbulbO] It depends merely on the distance $r = \|\x - \x^\prime\|$ $\to$ isotropic and stationary.\lz
\item[\faLightbulbO] Infinitely differentiable $\to$ the corresponding GP is too smooth.\lz
\item[\faLightbulbO] It utilizes strong smoothness assumptions $\to$ unrealistic for modeling most of the physical processes.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[c,allowframebreaks]{Upcrossing Rate and Characteristic Length-Scale}

\begin{itemize}
\item Another way to describe a Gaussian process is the expected number of up-crossings at level-0 on the unit interval, which we denote by $N_0$.
\vspace{3mm}
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width = 0.45\textwidth]{figure/upcrossings-1.pdf}
\end{figure}

\item For an isotropic covariance function $k(r)$, the expected number of up-crossings can be calculated explicitly:
$$
\expectation[N_0] = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{- k^{\prime\prime}(0)}{k(0)}}.
$$

\end{itemize}


\framebreak
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Example (squared exponential):
\vspace{-3mm}
\begin{eqnarray*}
k(r) &=& \exp\biggl(-\frac{r^2}{2\ls^2}\biggr)\\
k^\prime(r) &=& - k(r) \cdot \frac{r}{\ls^2} \\
k^{\prime\prime}(r) &=&  k(r) \cdot \frac{r^2}{\ls^4} - k(r) \cdot \frac{1}{\ls^2}
\end{eqnarray*}

\vspace{5mm}
The expected number of upcrossings at level-0 is

$$
\E[N_0] = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{- k^{\prime\prime}(0)}{k(0)}} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{1}{\ls^2}} = (2\pi \ls)^{-1}.
$$

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

$\ls$ is called \textbf{characteristic length-scale}. Loosely speaking, the characteristic length-scale describes how far you need to move in input space for the function values to become uncorrelated. 

\begin{itemize}
\item[\faLightbulbO] Left plot: for higher $\ls$ the correlation between function values (for unchanged distance of input points) is also higher
\item[\faLightbulbO] Right plot: a higher $\ls$ induces a smoother function and thus fewer level-0 upcrossings
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3mm}

\framebreak
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

For more than $p = 2$ dimensions, the squared exponential can be parameterized as follows:

$$
k(\xI{i}, \xI{j}) = \variance_f \exp\,\biggl(- \frac{1}{2}\left(\xI{i} - \xI{j}\right)^\top\bm{M}\left(\xI{i} - \xI{j}\right)\biggr)
$$

\vspace{7mm}

Possible choices for the matrix $\bm{M}$ include

$$
\bm{M}_1 = \ls^{-2}\id \qquad \bm{M}_2 = \text{diag}(\bm{\ls})^{-2} \qquad \bm{M}_3 = \Gamma \Gamma^\top + \text{diag}(\bm{\ls})^{-2}
$$

where $\bm{\ls}$ is a $p$-vector of positive values and $\Gamma$ is a $p \times k$ matrix. 

\lz 
\lz

Here again, $\bm{\ls} = (\ls_1,\dots, \ls_p)$ are characteristic length-scales for each dimension.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

What is the benefit of learning an individual hyperparameter $\ls_i$ for each dimension?

\vspace{4mm}

\begin{itemize} 
\item The $\ls_1,\dots, \ls_p$ hyperparameters play the role of \textbf{characteristic length-scales}.
\vspace{2mm}
\item Losely speaking, $\ls_i$ describes how far you need to move along axis $i$ in input space for the function values to be uncorrelated.
\vspace{2mm}
\item Such a covariance function implements \textbf{automatic relevance determination} (ARD), since the inverse of the length-scale $\ls_i$ determines the relevancy of input feature $i$ to the regression.
\vspace{2mm}
\item If $\ls_i$ is very large, the covariance will become almost independent of that input, effectively removing it from inference.
\vspace{2mm}
\item If the features are on different scales, the data can be automatically \textbf{rescaled} by estimating $\ls_1,\dots, \ls_p$ 

\end{itemize}

For the first plot, we have chosen $\bm{M} = \id$: the function varies the same in all directions. The second plot is for $\bm{M} = \text{diag}(\bm{\ls})^{-2}$ and $\bm{\ls} = \left(1, 3 \right)$: The function varies less rapidly as a function of $x_2$ than $x_1$ as the length-scale for $x_1$ is less. In the third plot $\bm{M} = \Gamma \Gamma^T + \text{diag}(\bm{\ls})^{-2}$ for $\Gamma = (1, -1)^\top$ and $\bm{\ls} = (6, 6)^\top$. Here $\Gamma$ gives the direction of the most rapid variation. \lit{\href{http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW.pdf\#page=125&zoom=auto,-17,731}{Rasmussen and Williams. 2006 }}%(Image from Rasmussen \& Williams, 2006)
