\begin{frame}[c, allowframebreaks]{Review: The Bayesian Linear Model}

Let $\datasettrain = \left\{(\xI{1},\yI{1}), ..., (\xI{n},\yI{n})\right\}$ be a training set of i.i.d. observations from some unknown distribution.
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figure_man/bayes-lm/example.pdf}
\end{figure}

Let $\textbf{y} = (\yI{1}, ..., \yI{n})^\top$ and $\Xmat \in \realnum^{n \times p}$ be the design matrix where the i-th row contains vector $\xI{i}$. 





%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\framebreak

The linear regression model is defined as


$$
\yI{i} = f(\xI{i}) + \epsilon^{(i)} = \bm{\weights}^\top \xI{i} + \epsilon^{(i)} \text{, for all } i \in \{1,\dots,n\}.
$$

\lz 

\lz 

The observed values $\yI{i}$ differ from the function values $f(\xI{i})$ by some additive noise, which is assumed to be i.i.d. Gaussian 
$$\epsilon^{(i)} \sim \normaldist (0, \variance).$$


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\framebreak
\begin{itemize}
  \item Let us assume we have \textbf{prior beliefs} about the parameter $\thetab$ that are represented in a prior distribution $\thetab \sim \normaldist (\zero, \tau^2 \id_p).$

\lz
\lz

\item Whenever data points are observed, we update the parameters' prior distribution according to Bayes' rule

\end{itemize}




$$
\underbrace{p(\thetab \mid \Xmat, \ydat)}_{\text{posterior}} = \frac{\overbrace{p(\ydat \mid \Xmat, \thetab)}^{\text{likelihood}}\overbrace{q(\thetab)}^{\text{prior}}}{\underbrace{p(\ydat\mid\Xmat)}_{\text{marginal}}}.
$$


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\framebreak

The posterior distribution of the parameter $\thetab$ is again normal distributed (the Gaussian family is self-conjugate): 

$$
\thetab \mid \Xmat, \ydat \sim \normaldist(\sigma^{-2}\bm{A}^{-1}\Xmat^\top\ydat, \bm{A}^{-1})\text{, where }\bm{A}:= \sigma^{-2}\Xmat^\top\Xmat + \frac{1}{\tau^2} \id_p.
$$


\lz 

\begin{footnotesize}
\textbf{Note:} If the posterior distributions $p(\thetab\mid\Xmat, \ydat)$ are in the same probability distribution family as the prior $q(\thetab)$, the prior and posterior are then called \textbf{conjugate distributions}, and the prior is  called a \textbf{conjugate prior} for the likelihood function $p(\ydat\mid\Xmat, \thetab)$. 
\end{footnotesize}

\lz

\begin{footnotesize}
\textbf{Note:} The Gaussian family is \textbf{self-conjugate} with respect to a Gaussian likelihood function: choosing a Gaussian prior for a Gaussian likelihood ensures that the posterior is also Gaussian.

\begin{footnotesize}
\textbf{Theorem:}\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item For a Gaussian prior on $\thetab \sim \normaldist(\zero, \tau^2 \id_p)$ and a Gaussian likelihood $y \mid \Xmat, \thetab \sim \normaldist(\Xmat^\top \thetab, \sigma^2 \id_n)$, the resulting posterior is Gaussian: $\normaldist(\sigma^{-2}\bm{A}^{-1}\Xmat^\top\ydat, \bm{A}^{-1})$, with $\bm{A}:= \sigma^{-2}\Xmat^\top\Xmat + \frac{1}{\tau^2} \id_p$.
  \end{itemize}

\vspace{+.2cm}
\textbf{Proof:}\\
Plugging in Bayes' rule and multiplying out yields

\vspace{-.5cm}

\begin{eqnarray*}
p(\thetab \mid \Xmat, \ydat) &\propto& p(\ydat \mid \Xmat, \thetab) q(\thetab) \propto \exp\biggl[-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(\ydat - \Xmat\thetab)^\top(\ydat - \Xmat\thetab)-\frac{1}{2\tau^2}\thetab^\top\thetab\biggr] \\
&=& \exp\biggl[-\frac{1}{2}\biggl(\underbrace{\sigma^{-2}\ydat^\top\ydat}_{\text{doesn't depend on } \thetab} - 2 \sigma^{-2} \ydat^\top \Xmat \thetab + \sigma^{-2}\thetab^\top \Xmat^\top \Xmat \thetab  + \tau^{-2} \thetab^\top\thetab \biggr)\biggr] \\
&\propto& \exp\biggl[-\frac{1}{2}\biggl(\sigma^{-2}\thetab^\top \Xmat^\top \Xmat \thetab  + \tau^{-2} \thetab^\top\thetab  - 2 \sigma^{-2} \ydat^\top \Xmat \thetab \biggr)\biggr] \\
&=& \exp\biggl[-\frac{1}{2}\thetab^\top\underbrace{\biggl(\sigma^{-2} \Xmat^\top \Xmat + \tau^{-2} \id_p \biggr)}_{:= \Amat} \thetab + \textcolor{red}{\sigma^{-2} \ydat^\top \Xmat \thetab}\biggr]
\end{eqnarray*}

This expression resembles a normal density - except for the term in red!


%\end{footnotesize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\framebreak

\textbf{Note:} We need not worry about the normalizing constant since its mere role is to convert probability functions to density functions with a total probability of one.

\vspace{+.2cm}

We subtract a (not yet defined) constant $c$ while compensating for this change by adding the respective terms (``adding $0$''), emphasized in green:

\vspace{-.5cm}

\begin{eqnarray*}
	p(\thetab | \Xmat, \ydat) &\propto&  \exp\biggl[-\frac{1}{2}(\thetab \textcolor{green}{- c})^\top\Amat  (\thetab \textcolor{green}{- c}) \textcolor{green}{- c^\top \Amat \thetab} + \underbrace{\textcolor{green}{\frac{1}{2}c^\top\Amat c}}_{\text{doesn't depend on } \thetab} +\sigma^{-2} \ydat^\top \Xmat \thetab\biggr] \\
	&\propto& \exp\biggl[-\frac{1}{2}(\thetab \textcolor{green}{- c})^\top\Amat  (\thetab \textcolor{green}{- c}) \textcolor{green}{- c^\top \Amat \thetab} +\sigma^{-2} \ydat^\top \Xmat \thetab\biggr]
\end{eqnarray*}

If we choose $c$ such that $- c^\top \Amat \thetab +\sigma^{-2} \ydat^\top \Xmat \thetab = 0$, the posterior is normal with mean $c$ and covariance matrix $\Amat^{-1}$. Taking into account that $\Amat$ is symmetric, this is if we choose

\vspace{-.5cm}

\begin{eqnarray*}
&& \sigma^{-2} \ydat^\top \Xmat = c^\top\Amat \\
&\Leftrightarrow & \sigma^{-2} \ydat^\top \Xmat \Amat^{-1} = c^\top \\
&\Leftrightarrow& c = \sigma^{-2} \Amat^{-1} \Xmat^\top \ydat
\end{eqnarray*}

\vspace{-.3cm}

as claimed.

\begin{itemize}

\item Based on the posterior destribution, 
$\thetab \mid \Xmat, \ydat \sim \normaldist(\sigma^{-2}\bm{A}^{-1}\Xmat^\top\ydat, \bm{A}^{-1})$,
we can derive the predictive distribution for a new observations $\x_*$.

\lz

\item The predictive distribution for the Bayesian linear model, i.e. the distribution of $\thetab^\top \x_*$, is
$$y_* \mid \Xmat, \ydat, \x_* \sim \normaldist(\sigma^{-2}\ydat^\top \Xmat \Amat^{-1}\x_*, \x_*^\top\Amat^{-1}\x_*).$$
\end{itemize}

\lz

\textbf{Note:} This can be obtained by applying the rules for linear transformations of Gaussians.

\begin{frame}[c]{Summary: The Bayesian Linear Model}

\begin{itemize}
  \item By switching to a Bayesian perspective, we have not only point estimation for the parameter $\thetab$ but also whole \textbf{distributions}.
  \lz
  \item From the posterior distribution of $\thetab$, we can derive a predictive distribution for $y_* = \thetab^\top \x_*$.  
  \lz
  \item We can perform online updates: the \textbf{posterior distribution} of $\thetab$ can be updated whenever new datapoints are observed. 
\lz
\item In the next step, we would like go beyond the linear funtions and develop a theory for functions with general shapes.
